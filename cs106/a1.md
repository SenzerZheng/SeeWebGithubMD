## Part One: Stack Overflows

Whenever a program calls a function, the computer sets aside memory called a ***stack frame\*** for that function call in a region called the ***call stack\***. Whenever a function is called, it creates a new stack frame, and whenever a function returns the space for that stack frame is recycled.

As you saw on Wednesday, whenever a recursive function makes a recursive call, it creates a new stack frame, which in turn might make more stack frames, which in turn might make even more stack frames, etc. For example, when we computed `factorial(5)`, we ended up creating a net of six stack frames: one for each of `factorial(5)`, `factorial(4)`, `factorial(3)`, `factorial(2)`, `factorial(1)`, and `factorial(0)`. They were automatically cleaned up as soon as those functions returned.

But what would happen if you called `factorial` on a very large number, say, `factorial(7897987)`? This would create a lot of stack frames; specifically, it will make 7,897,988 of them (one for `factorial(7987987)`, one for `factorial(7987986)`, â€¦, and one for `factorial(0)`). This is such a large number of stack frames that the call stack might not have space to store them. When too many stack frames need to be created at the same time, the result is a ***stack overflow\*** and the program will crash.

In the case of `factorial(7987987)`, a stack overflow occurs because we need a large but finite number of stack frames. In other cases, stack overflows arise due to programming errors. For example, consider the following (buggy!) implementation of the digitalRootOf function from Fridayâ€™s lecture:

```c++
/* This code is incorrect! Do not use it as a reference. */
int digitalRootOf(int n) {
    return digitalRootOf(sumOfDigitsOf(n));
}
```

Letâ€™s imagine that you try calling `digitalRootOf(7897987)`. The initial stack frame looks like this:

> ![A stack frame for `digitalRootOf` with `n = 7897987`](img/digital-root-1.png)

This stack frame calls `digitalRootOf(sumOfDigitsOf(7897987))`. The sum of the digits in the number is 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 55, so this fires off a call to `digitalRootOf(55)`, as shown here:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 55`. There are two stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-2.png)

This now calls `digitalRootOf(sumOfDigitsOf(55))`, which ends up calling `digitalRootOf(10)`:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 10`. There are three stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-3.png)

This now calls `digitalRootOf(sumOfDigitsOf(10))`, which ends up calling `digitalRootOf(1)`:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 1`. There are four stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-4.png)

This now calls `digitalRootOf(sumOfDigitsOf(1))`, which ends up calling `digitalRootOf(1)` again, as shown here:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 1`. There are five stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-5.png)

This call makes yet another call to `digitalRootOf(1)` for the same reason:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 1`. There are six stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-6.png)

And *that* call makes yet *another* call to `digitalRootOf(1)`:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 1`. There are seven stack frames in total at this point.](img/digital-root-7.png)

As you can see, this recursion is off to the races. Itâ€™s like an infinite loop, but with function calls. This code will trigger a stack overflow because at some point it will exhaust the memory in the call stack.

Another place youâ€™ll see stack overflows is when you have a recursive function that, for some reason, misses or skips over its base case. For example, letâ€™s suppose you want to write a function `isEven` that takes as input a number *n* and returns whether itâ€™s an even number. You note that 0 is even (trust us, it is; take CS103 for details!) and, more generally, a number *n* is even precisely if *n* â€“ 2 is even. For example, 2 is even because 2 â€“ 2 = 0 is even, 4 is even because 4 â€“ 2 = 2 is even, and 6 is even because 6 â€“ 2 = 4 is even, etc. Based on this (correct) insight, you decide to write this (incorrect) recursive function:

```c++
/* This code is incorrect! Do not use it as a reference. */
bool isEven(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return isEven(n - 2);
    }
}
```

Now, what happens if you call `isEven(5)`? This initially looks like this:

> ![A stack frame for `isEven` with `n = 5`](img/is-even-1.png)

This call will call `isEven(3)`, as shown here:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 3`. There are two stack frames in total at this point.](img/is-even-2.png)

And that call then calls `isEven(1)`:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = 1`. There are three stack frames in total at this point.](img/is-even-3.png)

And hereâ€™s where things go wrong. This function now calls `isEven(-1)`, skipping over the base case:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = -1`. There are four stack frames in total at this point.](img/is-even-4.png)

This call then calls `isEven(-3)`:

> ![A new stack frame has been added on top of the previous one. This one has `n = -3`. There are five stack frames in total at this point.](img/is-even-5.png)

And weâ€™re off to the Stack Overflow Races â€“ *n* will keep getting more negative until weâ€™re out of space.

### Step One: See a Stack Overflow

There are two different ways that you can run a C++ program through Qt Creator. The first is to run the program normally, which you can do by clicking the large green triangle "run" button. The second is to run the program with the debugger engaged, which you saw how to do in Assignment 0. The behavior of a program that triggers a stack overflow is different based on whether it's running with the debugger on or off.

To see this, run the provided starter files without the debugger engaged (that is, with the green triangle run button). Click the "Stack Overflows" option. You'll see a message and a button at the bottom of the window that will trigger a stack overflow. Click that button and watch what happens. This is what it looks like when a C++ program crashes. What you see will depend on what operating system you're using. ***Write down a description of what you saw happen in the file comments of `StackOverflow.cpp`, up at the top of the file.\*** Now, if you see similar behavior in the future, you'll be able to say "oh yeah, that probably means my program crashed."

- #It just break and return to Qt,then shows:

```bash
16:49:41: The process "/usr/bin/make" exited normally.
16:49:41: Elapsed time: 00:00.
```

Next, run the program again, but this time with the debugger turned on. Follow the same steps as above to trigger the stack overflow. This time, you should see the debugger pop up and point at a line in the program where the stack overflow occurred. You'll also see the call stack, which should be filled with lots and lots of calls to the same function. Now that you've got the debugger engaged, you can investigate which function triggered the stack overflow and, ideally, to work out what went wrong. You don't need to write anything down just yet. For now, hit the red "stop" button to close the program.

Going forward, as you're writing your first recursive functions, keep what you just saw in mind. If you see something that looks like your program crashed with a stack overflow, turn on the debugger and run it again. You'll then be taken to the exact spot where the stack overflow occurred, and from there you can walk the call stack to see what's up. Do you see multiple calls to a recursive function with the same parameters? Or a sequence of negative values getting more negative? That might indicate what's going on.
