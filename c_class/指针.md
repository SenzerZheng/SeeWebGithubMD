# 指针

## 指针变量

### 指针变量的声明

>  As far as C goes they both do the same thing. It is a matter of preference. `int* i` shows clearly that it is an int pointer type. `int *i` shows the fact that the asterisk only affects a single variable. So `int *i, j` and `int* i, j` would both create `i` as an int pointer and `j` as an int.

```c
int *i, j;//create `i` as an int pointer and `j` as an int
```

故推荐`*`这样写`int *i`	。

这里可以解释为：`*`是一个表达式中的一元运算符，故先求出`(*i)`的值。
