It is a valuable resource for learning about and working with Java.

To search for a specific function like `System.out.print` on the Java documentation website, you can use the search bar at the top of the page. Simply type in the name of the function you are looking for, and the search results will show you the relevant pages where the function is mentioned.

Alternatively, you can also use the navigation menu on the left side of the page to browse through the different packages and classes in the Java Standard Library. The `System` class is located in the `java.lang` package, so you can click on that package in the navigation menu to see a list of all the classes and interfaces it contains. From there, you can click on the `System` class to see its documentation, which will include information about the `out` field and the `print` method.
