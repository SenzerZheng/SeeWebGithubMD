# A topic will disappear in TOC under  certain circumstance

Hello, thanks for great extension,it helps me a lot as I'm new to markdown and vscode. But I have little issue about table of contents.

## Problem

I find that a topic like `##this topic is not in TOC` will disappear in TOC sometimes.When a `- ` is before a code block like`code block 1` and the topic is in front of another code block like`code block 2`.
I wonder if it's a bug or some syntax rules?I check markdownlint but it didn't warn me angything
