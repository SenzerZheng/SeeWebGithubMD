## Table of contents using md all in one

### Create table of contents

- After create table of contents by ctrl + Shift + P,the code block style by markdownlint will become fence,so don't use tab to create code block.

### Update table of contents

### Use

- Get the structure of md file, but can't directly jump to topics.You should click the #topics with ctrl.

## The pictures

- if you want to edit the pictures' size,you'd better use typora,but it will also poduce a warning because it's js?
