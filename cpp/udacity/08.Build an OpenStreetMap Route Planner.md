# Build an OpenStreetMap Route Planner

In this project you will extend the IO2D map display code to use A*, so your program will be able to find a path between two points on the map.

## Concept 01: Project Intro

### Lecture

Welcome to the final project.

In this project, you will use everything that you've learned up to now,including writing code in multiple files,pointers, references, and a little bit of OOP. 

You will build a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map.This may sound similar to the project you completed in the first lessons of this course.

This time however, instead of using a simple grid to represent the map,you'll be working with real map data from the OpenStreetMap project to generate a path on a real map.This is similar to other mapping applications you have used,like Google Maps or Apple Maps.To render the map data,the project code we'll be using a 2D rendering library called IO2D.Much of the code for passing OpenStreetMap data and rendering the results comes from the library example and the IO2D code repository.

To get you started on the project,we'll provide you with a slightly modified version of this example code that has all of the classes and methods stubs that you'll need to complete the project.

Your task will be to fill in the methods that are required to make the code perform route planning.The route planner will use the A* algorithm just as you've seen before.So the code structure should seem familiar to you from the first lessons of this course.

However, because of the complexity of the OpenStreetMap data and the IO2D library,the project code will have object-oriented structure.In the rest of this lesson,we'll carefully review the structure of the project code that we provide and we'll clarify what is required to complete the project.

In particular, we'll have an overview of the OpenStreetMap project,including the data format of the OpenStreetMap data and the element types that you'll see on that data.

Then you'll see instructions for building and running the project,and testing your code.

Next, you'll see a project code overview that will include a class diagram,so you can have an understanding of the high-level structure of the code.

Then you look at the project starter repository structure,including all of the files and folders in that project repository.

We'll look at the source directory in that repository in particular.We'll have some code workthroughs so that you understand all of the code that you're starting with.

Next, there'll be some steps that you'll need to follow to complete the project.

Then the last part of this lesson, there'll be project submission instructions and workspace.
This is an extremely exciting project and we can't wait to see your submissions.

### Content

Welcome to the course project! In this project, you will create a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map using real map data from the [OpenStreeMap project](). When you are finished with the project, your output should look like the image below:

## Concept 02: The OpenStreetMap Project

In the next classroom concepts, you will write a course project in C++ using real map data and A* search to find a path between two points, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application. The project you will will write will be using data from the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

The OpenStreetMap project is an open source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.

### OpenStreetMap Data

OpenStreetMap data can come in several different formats. The data that is used for this project comes in the form of an OSM XML file (.osm file), and we have provided a sample from the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) below. Although you may not have worked with this type of data before, have a look at the data below and try to guess which element types from the next quiz are present in the data. We are confident you can figure this out by carefully studying the data!

#### Question

Have a look at the element types in the XML map data below. Which of the following types do you see in the data?

- [ ] node
- [ ] way
- [ ] relation

```xml

```

#### Solution

- node
- way
- relation

### Data Types Overview

Excellent work in guessing the types present in the data above! If you look closely at the XML element types in the sample above, you should see the three element types which are important to the code you will be writing: Nodes, Ways, and Relations.

#### Node

<img src="img/node.png" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

A [*node*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node) is one of the most basic elements in the OpenStreetMap data model. Each node indicates a single point with an identifier `id`, latitude `lat`, and longitude `lon`. There are other XML attributes in a node element that won't be relevant to this project, such as the `user` id and the `timestamp` when the node was added to the data set. Additionally, a node can have several tags which provide additional information.

#### Way

<img src="img/way.png" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

A [*way*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way) is an ordered list of nodes that represents a feature in the map. This feature could be a road, or a boundary of a park, or some other feature in the map. Each way has at least one `tag` which denotes some information about the way, and each way also belongs to at least one relation, which is described below.

#### Relation

<img src="img/relation.png" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

A [*relation*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) is a data structure which documents a relationship between other data elements. Examples from the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) include:

> - A route relation which lists the ways that form a major highway, cycle route, or bus route.
> - A multipolygon that describes an area with holes, where the outer and inner boundaries of the area are given by two ways.

#### Example

To help you understand how all these types are used together, consider the following [example from the OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:waterway%3Driverbank) of mapping a large river with distinct banks on either side of the river. In the image below, nodes are used to provide the coordinates of points along the banks of the river. Multiple nodes are then connected using ways; there are ways which form closed sections of the river, labeled as "Areas" in the image below. Another way is used to represent the island in the middle of the river. These ways are then grouped together using a relation, which represents the entire river.

![img](img/osm-river.png)

**QUIZ QUESTION:**:

Imagine you are going to create a bus route using OpenStreetMap data. Match the OpenStreetMap data type with the part of the bus route it represents.

**ANSWER CHOICES:**

- [ ] Relation
- [ ] Way
- [ ] Node

**Solution**

| Bus Route Part                                           | OSM Data Type |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| A collection of points that form a road on the bus route | Relation      |
| A single point on the bus route                          | Way           |
| A collection of roads the form the entire route          | Node          |

### Up Next

For your project, you will primarily be working with Nodes, although the code that we provide determines which nodes are neighbors by using the ways and relations those nodes belong to.

Both the code to parse the OSM data and the data structures which are used to store the data in your program have already been written in the [IO2D OpenStreetMap example](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/tree/master/P0267_RefImpl/Samples/maps). In your project, you won't need to recreate any of this code - you task will be writing code that extends the code in order to plot a path between two points.

Up next, you will learn how to build, run, and test the project code. After that, we'll have an in-depth look at the files in the project starter code so you will be prepared to work on your project.

## Concept 03: Building and Running

To get started with your project, you can download the code from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project), or you can use the workspace provided below. If you decide to work on this project on your local machine, you will need to install the dependencies outlined in the GitHub [README](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project/blob/master/README.md) for the project.

In this classroom concept, you will see the instructions for building, running, and testing your project. In the next classroom concept, you will see a detailed overview of the project code, so you'll be well prepared to start work on the project.

### Building

This project will use CMake as the build system. Building the project code can be done from the terminal workspace or from the virtual desktop workspace. It is also possible to build this project locally. To do this, you will need to install the project dependencies in your local environment, including the IO2D library, which can be difficult. The complete list of dependencies can be found in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project/blob/master/README.md) for the project.

#### Building Using Udacity Workspaces

You can use either of the following ways to build the project using Udacity workspace:

1. Using the terminal workspace.
2. Using the virtual desktop by clicking on the "Desktop" button. If using the virtual desktop, **you will want to use a terminal from within VS Code**, as the correct compiler options have been set up in the VS Code preferences. See the video below for a walkthrough of how to do this.
