```shell
youhuangla@Ubuntu stdman-master % man std::cout 
std::cout,std::wcout(3)        C++ Standard Libary        std::cout,std::wcout(3)

NAME
       std::cout,std::wcout - std::cout,std::wcout

Synopsis
          Defined in header <iostream>
          extern std::ostream cout;    (1)
          extern std::wostream wcout;  (2)

          The  global objects std::cout and std::wcout control output to a stream
       buffer of
          implementation-defined type (derived from  std::streambuf),  associated
       with the
          standard C output stream stdout.

          These  objects  are  guaranteed  to be initialized during or before the
       first time an
          object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for
       use in the
          constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initializa‐
       tion (as long
          as <iostream> is included before the object is defined).
